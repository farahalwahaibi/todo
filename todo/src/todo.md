### **LAB - 31**

**To Do List Manager Phase 1:** Begin the build of an application designed for creating and organizing a “To Do” list in your browser.

In this initial phase, we’re going to have to start by converting a legacy application into a more modern architecture. Our initial “Proof of Concept” was written using class based components and was not properly styled. Now that our client has given us the “green light” for development, we’re going to refactor the application using Hooks and upgrading the style.

#### **Phase 1 Requirements**

Today, we begin the first of a 4-phase build of the To Do List Manager, a web-based task manager application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a foundational system using React hooks that we can build upon in later phases, adding databases, logins, and more advanced features.

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project :

* As a user, I would like an easy way to add a new to do item using an online interface
* As a user, I would like my to do items to have an assignee, due date, difficulty meter, status and the task itself
* As a user, I would like to delete to do items that are no longer needed
* As a user, I would like to easily mark to do items as completed
* As a user, I would like to edit an existing to do item
